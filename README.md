# Predicting Stock Prices with Machine Learning

This is an attemp of me to create a machine learning model that can load and utilize stock price data. It can also predict stock prices 30 days in the future. 

This task was accomplished with the help of <i> TheCodex.me </i> <a href="https://thecodex.me/">see here </a>. It is an exertion to build a linear regression model with <b> SKLearn </b>, load and analyze stock price data, and predict stock prices 30 days in the future. The data came from <em> Quandl Team </em> site.
